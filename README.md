# Gmail-and-Outlook-Plugin
build Gmail and Outlook plugins that integrate seamlessly with our internal application.
These plugins will allow users to authenticate using their internal application credentials, select an organization and folder, and upload email attachments directly to the desired location. The Gmail plugin should be implemented as a Chrome extension with Google Workspace Add-On compatibility, while the Outlook plugin should support both web and desktop versions using the Microsoft Office Add-In framework. Key features include automatic detection of email attachments, a user-friendly interface for selecting folders, renaming files, and a “Send” button to upload files securely. The solution must be highly secure, with OAuth 2.0 for authentication and encrypted data transfers. The final deliverable should include well-documented code, setup instructions, and thorough testing to ensure compatibility and reliability.
-------------
To build Gmail and Outlook plugins that integrate seamlessly with your internal application, we will need to break down the solution into two major components:

    Gmail Plugin (Chrome Extension + Google Workspace Add-On Compatibility):
        We will create a Chrome extension using JavaScript and the Gmail API to allow users to authenticate, select an organization and folder, and upload email attachments to the selected location.
    Outlook Plugin (Web and Desktop Add-In using Microsoft Office Add-In Framework):
        We will create an Outlook add-in using the Microsoft Office JavaScript API (Office.js) to authenticate using OAuth 2.0, detect email attachments, and upload them to the desired location.

General Requirements for Both Plugins:

    Authentication: Use OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.
    Attachment Handling: Automatically detect email attachments and allow users to select folders and rename files.
    Secure File Upload: Implement secure file upload functionality using HTTPS.
    User Interface: A simple, user-friendly interface for selecting folders and uploading files.
    Compatibility: Ensure that both plugins work with Gmail/Outlook on both web and desktop platforms.

Steps for Gmail Plugin (Chrome Extension + Google Workspace Add-On)

    Authentication with OAuth 2.0:
        Use Google’s OAuth 2.0 for authenticating users and interacting with Gmail API.

    Chrome Extension for Gmail:
        The extension should listen for new emails, identify attachments, and provide a user interface for selecting folders and uploading files.

    Google Workspace Add-On for Gmail:
        Google Workspace Add-On will also provide the same functionality but as an integrated Gmail sidebar for users to interact directly within Gmail's UI.

Gmail Plugin Code Example (Chrome Extension + Google Workspace Add-On)

// manifest.json
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Gmail Attachment Uploader",
  "description": "Upload Gmail attachments to your organization folder",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": [
    "identity",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/*"
  ],
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"],
    "persistent": false
  },
  "browser_action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  },
  "oauth2": {
    "client_id": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify"]
  }
}

// background.js
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function() {
  console.log("Gmail Attachment Uploader Extension Installed.");
  // Check if user is authenticated and authorized
  checkAuthentication();
});

function checkAuthentication() {
  // Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication with Gmail API
  gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance().isSignedIn.listen(handleAuthResult);
  if (gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance().isSignedIn.get()) {
    fetchEmails();
  } else {
    authenticateUser();
  }
}

function authenticateUser() {
  gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance().signIn().then(function() {
    fetchEmails();
  });
}

function fetchEmails() {
  // Fetch emails and display attachments to the user
  gapi.client.gmail.users.messages.list({
    'userId': 'me',
    'q': 'has:attachment'
  }).then(function(response) {
    const messages = response.result.messages;
    messages.forEach(function(message) {
      // Fetch message details to find attachments
      gapi.client.gmail.users.messages.get({
        'userId': 'me',
        'id': message.id
      }).then(function(messageDetails) {
        displayAttachments(messageDetails);
      });
    });
  });
}

function displayAttachments(messageDetails) {
  // Code to display attachments and upload option in the UI
  // Show message with attachments in popup or sidebar
}

This is a basic start for your Gmail extension that handles authentication and fetching of emails with attachments. You would need to expand it with specific logic to display attachments, allow users to select folders, and implement the upload functionality.
Steps for Outlook Plugin (Web and Desktop Add-In using Office Add-In Framework)

    Authentication with OAuth 2.0:
        Use Microsoft’s OAuth 2.0 for authenticating users and interacting with Outlook API.

    Office Add-In for Outlook:
        An Outlook add-in allows integration directly inside the Outlook web and desktop applications. You’ll need to create a manifest file for the add-in and use JavaScript to interact with the Outlook API.

    Outlook Add-In Setup:
        The Outlook add-in allows interaction with email messages, extracting attachments, and sending them to your internal system or cloud storage.

Outlook Plugin Code Example (Office Add-In Framework)

<!-- manifest.xml -->
<OfficeApp xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appforoffice/2017/04">
  <Id>com.example.outlook.attachmentuploader</Id>
  <Version>1.0.0.0</Version>
  <ProviderName>My Company</ProviderName>
  <DefaultLocale>en-US</DefaultLocale>
  <DisplayName>Attachment Uploader</DisplayName>
  <Description>Upload Outlook attachments to your organization folder</Description>
  <IconUrl DefaultValue="https://example.com/icon.png" />
  <AppDomains>
    <AppDomain>https://yourserver.com</AppDomain>
  </AppDomains>

  <Permissions>ReadWriteItem</Permissions>

  <Hosts>
    <Host Name="Outlook" />
  </Hosts>

  <Resources>
    <ExtensionPoint Type="MessageReadCommandSurface">
      <CommandSurface>
        <Button>
          <Label>Upload Attachments</Label>
          <Action Type="ExecuteFunction" Function="uploadAttachments" />
        </Button>
      </CommandSurface>
    </ExtensionPoint>
  </Resources>

  <FunctionFile resid="functionFile" />
</OfficeApp>

<!-- Function to upload attachments (Office.js API) -->
<script>
  Office.onReady(function (info) {
    if (info.host === Office.HostType.Outlook) {
      console.log("Outlook add-in loaded");
    }
  });

  function uploadAttachments() {
    // Use Office.js to get the current email item
    var item = Office.context.mailbox.item;
    
    // Check if there are attachments
    if (item.attachments.length > 0) {
      item.attachments.forEach(function(attachment) {
        // Upload attachments to your internal system
        uploadToServer(attachment);
      });
    } else {
      console.log("No attachments found");
    }
  }

  function uploadToServer(attachment) {
    // Make an API call to upload the attachment to the desired folder
    fetch('https://yourserver.com/upload', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + yourAccessToken,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        attachment: attachment
      })
    }).then(response => {
      if (response.ok) {
        console.log("Attachment uploaded successfully");
      }
    }).catch(error => {
      console.error("Error uploading attachment:", error);
    });
  }
</script>

Authentication and Integration

    OAuth 2.0 Integration: Use OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication in both Gmail and Outlook plugins. This involves integrating Google’s OAuth for Gmail and Microsoft’s OAuth for Outlook.

    Upload Functionality: Both plugins provide functionality to detect email attachments and upload them securely to the selected folder in your internal application.

    Encryption: Ensure that all data transferred is encrypted (use HTTPS for API calls) and that OAuth tokens are securely handled.

Final Steps for Deployment

    Testing: Test both Gmail and Outlook plugins thoroughly to ensure they work across both web and desktop platforms.
    Deployment: Publish the Chrome extension in the Google Chrome Web Store and deploy the Office Add-In to the Microsoft AppSource.
    Documentation: Provide setup instructions, detailed API documentation, and user guides for integration.
